			<h3>Doing Arts</h3>
			<p>“I like arts and crafts. I’m a creative / practical person, and like doing things with my hands."<br>"Doing it!! There are two ways I can regard art. The first is as a professional artist and secondly, experiencing the art of others. When I started what others came to call art, I was not trying to create art, I was trying to explore what intrigued me through making things, systems or images. I didn’t care if what I was doing was called art or not; I just wanted to enquire into things that puzzled me through making things or systems.”</p>

			<h3>Watching</h3>
			<p>“I like to watch anime mainly because it excels at providing positive emotions.<br>I do have some favorite movies, which I re-watch to receive positive emotions, but number of such movies is low. On other hand amount of anime, which bring me positive emotions is much higher. Also I like the art of anime and work of seiyuu is great, so it helps to enjoy anime even further. Some anime have great story, setting, so it helps to enjoy anime even further. Also anime often has likable characters, so just looking at them brings joy. Looking at human actors doesn’t have the same effect, effect is weaker.<br>In over-all anime is a great media, which brings positive emotions to me better than movies/serials. But I must say that some cartoons are great too and I gladly watch them too. But mainly I still prefer anime.”</p>
